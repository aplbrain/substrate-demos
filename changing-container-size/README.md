# changing-container-size

This example demonstrates the use of the `Visualizer#resize` function, which can take 0, 1, or 2 arguments.


`V.resize()` resizes to fill the container.

`V.resize(10, undefined)` resizes automatically in Y, and sizes to 10 pixels in X.

`V.resize(500, 100)` resizes to 500px X, 100px Y.
